## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### What if I do not set any colors under `WooCommerce > Settings > Order Note Colors` tab? ###
Then WooCommerce default order note color will be used.

### Will this plugin work for custom order status too? ###
Yep!

### Why it does not work for versions below WooCommerce 2.5 ###
WooCommerce has introduced a filter for order note classes in 2.5 So the plugin would work for WooCommerce 2.5 and above.

### What if I accidentally disable the plugin? ###
No worries - The order note colors will fall back to WooCommerce default colors. Also the plugin does not delete the saved colors on deactivation or deletion. So if you re-activate it or re-install it, you get your settings back.
